# anime-recommendation-system-using-Collaborative-Filtering-User-Based

Anime recommendation system works on collaborative filtering technique to recommend a user with a list of animes. 
This system is built on user-based method - according to which if users A,B like animes p, q & r, and a new user C likes animes p & q, then it's similar to users A & B and thus, is more likely to like anime r as well- that compares a user with other users in the database and comes up with a similarity index by comparing the ratings of animes by different users. The other users with high similarity index are segregated and to animes are enlisted from them.
